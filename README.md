# docker-nginxpm-deploy

Minimal, EoU-focused, web-app that helps deploying apps from git repos.

## Developing

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

## Roadmap

- [ ] import git repos
